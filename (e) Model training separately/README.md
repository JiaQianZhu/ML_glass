For properties with medium-sized datasets (>1000 entries),i.e., density and CTE, we split them into 80:20 proportions for separate training and testing.
For small datasets, i.e., Young's Modulus, Tsoft and Tstrain, we employed the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method in combination with CART, k-NN and RF algorithms.
