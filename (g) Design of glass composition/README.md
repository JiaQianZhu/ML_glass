In this part, we design a alogrithm to generate a series of possible ratios using joint prediction model.
We establish a target objective for advanced glass substrates, aiming to achieve optimal TPV performance as outlined below: density ≤ 2.5 g/cm³, CTE ranging from 3.3×10-6/K to 3.9×10-6/K, Young's modulus ≥ 80 GPa, Tstrain ≥ 993.15 K and Tsoft ≥ 1273.15 K.
