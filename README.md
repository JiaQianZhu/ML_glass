In this repository, we conducted machine learninng research on compositional design for high-performance glass substrates using medium to small dataset sizes. The dataset comprises 7 oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, MgO, SrO, B2O3, Sb2O3) and 5 properties (density, Young's Modulus, CTE, Tstrain and Tsoft). Firstly, we successfully employed RF, CART and k-NN algorithms to perform both individual and joint predictions, with RF reaching the highest R2 value of 0.9879. Then, our model achieved an accurate generalized prediction of 50 experimental data from a recent US patent released by Corning Incorporated. Lastly, we utilized the obtained joint prediction model to explore glass composition design and obtained a series of formulation data, demonstrating promising potential for future glass substrate design.
