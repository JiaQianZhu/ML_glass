Due to file size limitations, we are unable to upload the final joint prediction model.
However, readers can generate it themselves by running the relevant code as needed.
Here, we provide the best-performing models for individual predictions, SHAP plots, and the resulting series of oxide ratios. 
Unfortunately, the scatter density plot images are missing, but interested readers can generate them by running the relevant code.
