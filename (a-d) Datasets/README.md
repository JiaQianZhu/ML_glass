This section contains all the datasets used in the experiment. 
Under the 'raw' folder, you will find the original dataset we collected from the SciGlass database via a Python module named GlassPy (https://github.com/drcassar/glasspy). 
Under the 'clean' folder, you will find the individual datasets of five properties and final dataset for joint prediction both after completion.
We also mannually gathered a small dataset (~50 entries) of compositions released by Corning Incorporated (US 2020/0339468 A1), all of which were unseen during the training period. This dataset is named 'US_patent_data.csv'.
