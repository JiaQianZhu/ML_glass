This section contains all the datasets used in the experiment. 
Under the 'raw' folder, you will find the original dataset we collected from the SciGlass database via a Python module named GlassPy (https://github.com/drcassar/glasspy). 
Under the 'clean' folder, you will find the individual datasets of five properties and final dataset for joint prediction both after completion.
