Prior to applying the ML algorithms, ten different ones were tested on density and CTE datasets to evaluate their performance. 
These algorithms included RF, k-NN, CART, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Gaussian Process Regression, XGBoost, Lasso Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Multilayer Perceptron. 
Considering the experimental results, we ultimately chose the three ML algorithms, namely RF, k-NN and CART for our experimental design.
